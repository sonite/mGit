The Project can be found in "Only Logg" and opened with Programmers Notpad.
Important files like the different Stack files, can be found in Commons/Microchip.

This is a Project where the Melacs board are supposed to log everything on it's
analog inputs. Then save the log file to a SD card. Contents of the SD card can be 
reached through the local network if connected.

The SD card can also be reached through an usb connection.

Please contribute with ideas, fixes and solutions!

I know by experience that the new microchip stack's do some errors. Sometimes the device restart by the watchdog and for this I can't find the problem.

After a while with these new stack the logger stops logging and the http server can't be reached. But I can ping it. I think the problem might be something with open files not closed correctly or a buffer overflow.

The stacks are the latest from microchip (usb, ethernet, mdd).

Project is compiled by C18 3.42 and in extended mode.
